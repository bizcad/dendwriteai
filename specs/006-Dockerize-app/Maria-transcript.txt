Why Docker MCP changes everything
0:00
You guys.
0:01
Docker just dropped a new standard for AI tools and it completely changes
0:05
how we build things.
0:06
They took the raw MCP protocol and they turned it into something
0:10
that anyone can use.
0:11
You just click on a few buttons
0:13
and you give your agents an entire collection of superpowers.
0:17
You don't need any terminals or memorizing Docker commands.
0:20
Now everything is done through a friendly interface that even grandma approves.
0:25
You can't remember where you saved your API keys and it's okay.
0:29
You don't need them anymore.
0:30
You don't have the time to search for reliable servers.
0:33
You don't have to.
0:34
They're all bundled in one catalog with verified publishers.
0:38
You just pick and choose.
0:39
And for the first time ever, these friendly tools were made
0:42
both for AI users and AI developers.
0:45
So not only can you pull them into desktop assistants like Cursor and Claude, but
0:51
you can also integrate them in your own
0:54
AI projects that you built in VSCode.
0:58
So today I will show you three demos.
1:00
It will start by setting up Docker MCP for Cursor and Claude.
1:04
We will then integrate it into a basic Python application.
1:09
And then finally we will combine it in a full stack professional GUI
1:15
application, our own supercharged ChatGPT.
1:19
So if you're ready, let's roll.
1:28
So let's quickly see how it works.
1:29
Before we dive into details, let's say you're using something like Claude,
1:34
and you want your AI agent to be a bit more powerful
1:38
instead of just chatting with it.
1:39
You also want it to access your stripe account and read from it.
1:43
Check your invoices, create new ones, generate reports, and so on.
1:47
But why would you do that - if Calude can?
1:50
So first we will make sure we have the latest version of Docker
1:54
desktop installed.
1:56
4.54 on my end.
1:58
Then we will open the MCP toolkit tab on the left.
What MCP actually is (in plain English)
2:03
And if you're not sure what MCP means, it is a book of rules
2:08
that allows AI agents to read from external resources.
2:11
So, for example, your chats on discord or your financial records on stripe,
2:16
or your emails on Gmail.
2:17
We do it from special servers, the Discord or Stripe or Gmail designed
2:22
using the tools that they've built, like read emails or list contacts and so on.
Docker MCP Toolkit & Catalog overview
2:27
Now, the first thing we'll do in our toolkit is look at the clients, where
2:32
we can either download or connect to all kinds of AI desktop apps.
2:36
In my case, I'll go for Claude as well as for Cursor.
2:40
And then last but not least, I will go for visual Studio Code.
2:44
Let's connect to it.
2:45
And while Cursor and VSCode are free,
2:48
you will need a pro account for Claude, at least for its MCP features.
2:53
I've purchased it especially for this video so that you don't have to.
2:56
Now, once our connection is successful, we'll go ahead and relaunch
2:59
one of these apps.
3:00
In my case, I'll go for Cursor.
3:03
Then we will navigate to file followed by preferences,
Connecting Claude, Cursor, and VS Code
3:07
followed by Cursor settings and then tools and MCP and beautiful.
3:12
We already see MCP Docker available right over here.
3:16
And we also see that we have six different tools installed automatically.
3:20
Now these are special smart MCP tools that Docker provides.
3:25
They don't come from Stripe or Gmail but they are automatically embedded
3:29
inside the toolkit.
3:30
So what does it mean?
3:31
Well, if we close the settings tab and we start a new chat with control I,
3:36
we can then ask our agents to find the official stripe MCP server.
3:42
And then Cursor will use one of the Docker MCP tools.
3:46
This time MCP find to proceed with our task.
3:50
So let's quickly give it permissions. And beautiful.
3:52
We see that it found two different servers.
3:55
One of them is local and the other one is remote.
3:58
So let's quickly ask it to go for the remote server.
4:02
And now it will need another smart tool, this time MCP add.
4:07
And while we give it permissions,
Local vs Remote MCP servers (key differences)
4:09
let's quickly talk about the difference between local servers and remote ones.
4:12
Now back in Docker Desktop we see that both servers are official.
4:16
Given this known publisher icon, the local server is something you download
4:22
and then it runs on your system while the remote server
4:25
runs somewhere far away on Stripe's cloud.
4:29
Given this cloud icon meaning you're not downloading it,
4:32
and unlike the local server, this one is fully maintained by stripe.
4:37
They are constantly enhancing it and patching it so it is always up to date.
4:41
You connect to it once and then you forget about it.
4:44
In contrast, the local server is not automatically updated.
4:48
If there is a new version, it is up to you to upgrade it
4:51
by downloading it again and again and again.
4:54
Another benefit of remote servers is advanced security,
4:57
protecting you from prompt injections and all kinds of malicious inputs.
5:01
And then finally, remote servers don't need secrets
5:04
or API keys while the local servers do.
5:08
If it sounds a bit wild, let's see how it works right away.
5:13
So back in Cursor
5:14
we will allow it to open the browser authentication and we'll hit submit.
5:18
Then we will simply log in to our account like we usually do.
5:23
I will log into my fake bank account which is a very appropriate name.
5:27
And I will hit authorize.
5:28
Then don't forget to hit on Open Docker Desktop because this is very important.
5:33
Now if you're having some issues with the Cursor authentication
5:36
you can also authenticate through Docker desktop,
5:39
just expand the server and then go to the configurations tab.
5:43
Clicking on this authorize with the stripe OAuth provider link.
5:48
And then you can hit authorize right over here.
5:51
And it will take you
5:52
to the exact same browser page where you can authenticated from here.
5:56
But if everything fails, okay.
5:59
And the remote server goes buggy for some reason,
6:02
then you can always connect to the local one.
6:05
So let's find this one.
6:06
uhh, again.
6:08
This time not the cloud one, but the local one.
6:11
And then inside the configuration stab we will provide a secret key.
6:15
And here you paste your secret key. Where do you find it.
6:18
Well back in your stripe dashboard just type
6:22
API and follow this developers API keys link.
6:26
Here we will scroll down and we will create a secret key.
6:30
We will do so for building your own integration.
6:34
We will give this key some kind of a name let's call it Cursor
6:39
okay let's create it.
6:40
Then we will copy it and we will paste it inside our secret key section.
6:45
And we'll hit on this checkmark. Beautiful.
6:48
Now we can't access this key.
6:50
We cannot see it. It is absolutely blocked.
6:52
It is hidden even from us.
6:54
And we created this thing. So this is quite secure.
6:57
And it's just a nice alternative in case the remote server goes down or something
7:01
goes wrong.
7:02
Now a quick troubleshooting note before we move on.
7:05
If you properly set up your servers, but you still cannot see them in your My
7:08
Servers tab, let's go back to the catalog and let's add them manually.
7:13
We will do so by typing stripe, and we will click on this plus icon to add
7:17
these servers. We'll do it for both of them.
7:20
And it happens because the MCP toolkit is still in beta
7:23
so they're still working on it.
7:24
Now once we fix the issues with my servers,
7:27
we can then go back to Cursor where we have 31 tools and not just six.
7:32
Most of them are stripe tools. Great.
7:35
So now we can close these settings.
7:37
We can start a new chat and we can then ask Cursor,
Stripe MCP demo: real data, real actions
7:40
do I have any unpaid invoices on stripe.
7:44
And okay it found an invoice.
7:46
I have one unpaid invoice for the amount of $1,000
7:50
from a customer that ends with B4Y. Now
7:54
This is not the customer
7:55
name, this is just a unique ID that we are using for confidentiality.
7:59
If we are now navigating to my stripe account specifically to my open invoices,
8:04
we see that I have one open for the amount of 1,000 USD.
8:09
Amazing.
8:09
So Cursor does have access to my account, but here's something even cooler.
Using the same MCP tools across AI agents
8:14
If now we are opening Claude, then we don't need to set up anything,
8:19
we can immediately ask it to list all my customers and products on stripe
8:26
and Beautiful.
8:27
It found two customers and one of them ends with b4y,
8:31
which is a perfect match to our Cursor results.
8:34
Amazing.
8:35
So now what are we going to do is we're going to ask Claude
8:39
to create a new invoice for customer one.
8:43
The other guy that's right over here for the product of AI consulting.
8:48
Okay, let's give it a run and perfect.
8:51
The invoice was officially created and we can view it right over here.
8:55
Okay. There you go.
8:57
We have $500 that Eugene Krabs owes me.
9:00
If we refresh our open invoices, we now have two of them.
9:04
Amazing.
9:05
But now the final part of our demonstration will go back to Cursor,
9:10
and we'll ask it, were there any updates since the last time we checked?
9:15
Let's see what it says.
9:16
Let's expand it.
9:18
Let's scroll up and okay, we have a new unpaid invoice
9:22
for the amount of $500 for a customer that ends with 3iD.
9:27
Amazing.
9:28
So we have both of our agents interacting with my stripe account in real time.
How Docker acts as a single MCP gateway
9:33
Wow. Now what happens under the hood is we are setting.
9:37
Docker is a gatekeeper between MCP servers and AI applications.
9:42
It acts as sort of a middleman.
9:45
So in terms of Cursor, it doesn't really know
9:48
that three servers from three different providers are involved.
9:52
That's because the only thing it communicates with is Docker.
9:56
It doesn't count
9:57
three tools for Gmail and 22 tools for stripe, and 20 tools for discord.
10:02
Instead, it counts 45 tools for Docker,
10:07
plus the six smart tools that we got automatically.
10:10
Okay, but what if we don't care about using MCP servers?
10:15
What if we want to plug them into our own applications?
10:18
For example, let's say you're building a custom
10:21
AI app like ChatGPT and you want your users to enjoy Dockers
10:25
MCP catalog.
10:26
For this,
MCP inside your own Python app (VS Code)
10:27
we will switch to good old VSCode and we will leverage Dockers MCP gateway,
10:32
which is basically our catalog, but packaged in a container.
10:35
So let's quickly clone some starter files from my GitHub repository.
10:40
There you go. Docker MCP GUI App
10:42
You can find the link in the description.
10:44
We will click on code and it will copy the https address.
10:49
Then in our VSCode terminal
10:52
we will clone it with git clone followed by the address.
10:56
And we see that our project folder has two applications.
11:00
So let's start with the MCP demo app, which is the bare
11:03
minimum we need to run MCP with Docker.
11:07
So let's go ahead and open our Docker compose file
11:10
where we set different components of our app.
11:13
So if you are completely new to this, check out one of my previous Docker
11:17
tutorials.
11:18
Otherwise I will briefly explain it here and let me make things a bit smaller.
11:22
Now in Docker compose we will need three different services
11:25
or three independent components of the app.
11:29
The first one is the interface that users can access.
11:33
This is how users communicate with the app, in our case just through the console.
11:37
It's a simple demo, so this is all we need.
11:40
Next we have a gateway for local servers and it looks like that.
11:45
And then finally
11:46
we have a gateway for remote servers, and it looks similar to the local one.
11:51
But there is a few quirks here that we will discuss shortly.
11:54
Now when we access our local servers, in my case, DuckDuckGo and stripe,
12:00
we only specified their names, and we also mention that their secrets
12:05
are configured inside Docker desktop like we've done earlier with stripe.
12:10
We stored the secret key.
12:12
Actually, let me pull it out.
12:13
We went to Docker desktop, the local server,
12:16
and in the configuration tab we have this super secret secret key.
12:21
Great.
12:21
Now the way we talk to these servers is through a port on our system.
12:27
In my case, port 9011.
12:30
This is where our local servers live.
12:33
The remote ones, on the other hand, are communicating through port 8080.
12:39
And we're not just specifying their names like we've done over here,
12:44
but we are also including them
12:46
in a special catalog file that you can find in the same folder.
12:50
It's called catalog Yaml.
12:52
And the idea is we register each server separately.
12:57
Okay.
12:58
We have huggingface here and we have the stripe remote server right below it.
13:03
And we don't just specify the name, but we also specify the URL of these servers.
13:08
How do we find this URL.
13:10
Well we'll just go to Docker Desktop.
13:12
We will pull, let's say the Huggingface server.
13:14
And then in the overview section you find a link to the documentation.
13:18
Then we will scroll down and we will open the Visual Studio Code
13:23
tab where you can of course find this URL right over here.
13:27
Now another important component of this
13:29
catalog file is this secret key authorization.
13:33
So when we embed these servers into our personal applications,
13:37
the browser authentication that we've used earlier
13:40
is not going to work, at least not at this point in time.
13:43
So if we want to access our remote stripe account,
13:48
we will need to copy our secret key from earlier.
13:52
I have it right over here and it will paste it in the file
13:55
replacing this placeholder with it like so.
13:59
Now usually we don't store it here directly
14:02
because this is this is very confidential information.
14:06
I put it here just to keep things simple.
14:08
But I will show you a safer spot to store it shortly.
14:12
Another thing we need is a Dockerfile where we include instructions
14:15
for our container like installing Python and Pip installing a bunch of modules,
14:21
and even running App.py, which is the last file we need.
14:25
So let's quickly open it.
14:26
And as you may guess, this is where our Python application lives now.
Running MCP tools via code
14:31
In my case, I created a special function to call different tools
14:35
from different servers.
14:36
You can use it for any kind of tool from either remote or local servers,
14:41
and you can call it with arguments or without arguments.
14:45
It's a very versatile function and please feel free to adopt it.
14:48
But before you call it, make sure that you set up a proper URL
14:53
for your remote and local gateways so
14:56
the port number as well as the service
14:59
name must be a perfect match to what we have in Docker compose.
15:03
For example, if we set our gateway
15:06
local service to the port of 9011,
15:11
that's exactly what we write inside API.
15:14
You also need to know the name of the tool that you'd like to use.
15:18
So let's scroll down to this section.
15:21
And each and every tool call is separated by a whole bunch of hashtags.
15:26
So for example here we are calling the list customer tools from stripe.
15:31
And this tool doesn't expect any arguments.
15:34
But on the other hand, the search tool from DuckDuckGo
15:38
expects some kind of a search keyword in our case “cats”.
15:42
Now I will show you where
15:44
to find all these tool names and all their details shortly.
15:47
But for now, let's quickly run this app.
15:50
Mind you, because of how Docker structured things,
15:52
we don't even mention stripe or DuckDuckGo by name.
15:57
Okay, we skip the server names altogether and we only use the tool names because
16:02
again, as far as VSCode is concerned, the only server that exists is MCP Docker.
16:08
There's no such thing
16:09
as stripe or DuckDuckGo because only Docker knows that they exist.
16:13
Great.
16:14
So now let's pull up some kind of a terminal.
16:16
Let's create a new one.
16:18
Oh no, not a PowerShell one.
16:20
Okay, a WSL one.
16:22
And let's make sure we are in the correct directory.
16:24
So it will navigate to cd mcp demo app.
16:29
And from here we can run our demo application
16:32
with Docker compose up dash dash build and perfect.
16:38
Let's have a look at the results.
16:40
Just going to increase everything. Great.
16:42
So the list customers tool from stripe, both the local
16:46
and the remote returned the exact same result.
16:49
Here's our Bruce Wayne ID and here's our
16:53
what was it Eugene Crab ID?
16:56
So stripe officially works, but how about DuckDuckGo?
16:59
And okay, it found ten search results for Cat.
17:03
Great. And how about hugging face?
17:05
Let's scroll up.
17:06
Beautiful.
17:07
It found two papers that match the query Dolphins.
17:11
Amazing.
17:12
So now that we roughly know how these MCP tools work, let's
17:16
go ahead and combine them in a proper AI chat application.
17:21
For this, we will switch to the complete app right beside our MCP demo.
17:25
And this is a public template that I designed especially for you guys.
17:29
It is a solid foundation for professional AI assistants,
17:33
so please don't be shy to use it.
17:36
And what I did here is combining the new MCP functionality
Full-stack AI app with MCP + Model Runner
17:41
with my full stack application from previous tutorials.
17:45
I already showed you how to build it.
17:47
Okay, you may remember it.
17:49
I showed it in this video and we did it step by step.
17:52
Absolutely from scratch.
17:54
We used Docker Model Runner for this one and now we are just embedding Docker
17:59
MCP in it.
18:00
And of course including links both to this tutorial and to this GitHub repository.
18:05
But everything you need
18:07
is already on your computer and we just need to slightly set it up.
18:11
Now the first thing we'll do here is we will rename our example.env and file
18:17
that is too zoomed in okay.
18:19
We will rename this file to simply dot env.
18:22
And then we will copy our stripe secret key from earlier.
18:28
And we will then paste it inside this dot env file
18:31
replacing our placeholder right over here.
18:34
Beautiful.
18:35
So now instead of hard coding our secret key
18:39
inside catalog Yaml like we've done earlier,
18:43
we are simply assigning it to an environment variable
18:47
named Stripe Secrets, and then we are specifying it in the catalog.
18:52
This is way more secure because the dot env file is a hidden file.
18:56
Also, if you haven't watched my full stack tutorial,
19:00
you will need to open your Docker desktop and navigate to your models tab,
19:05
followed by the Docker Hub tab.
19:08
And here you will search for gemma3.
19:11
Great.
19:11
There you go.
19:12
We found it here and we can pull it into our computer.
19:15
And beautiful gemma3 is officially installed.
19:18
And this is a super small and friendly enough model to run on your CPU.
19:24
That's why I'm using it now.
19:25
You can install any other model.
19:27
Just please make sure you update the model name inside your dot env file.
19:33
Okay, so if you're downloading something else you can say
19:36
Qwen 2.5 or whatever it is you're using now.
19:41
Once our application is up and running, we will navigate to our browser
19:45
specifically to localhost in the port of 8501.
19:50
And beautiful.
19:51
This is where our GUI application lives.
19:53
And we can interact with our model through it.
19:55
Now in addition to chatting with the model let's ask it hi, how are you?
20:00
And then we'll get responses. As usual.
20:02
We can also invoke some MCP tools, and I actually prepared
20:06
some templates for these tools.
20:08
We can search for something on the web through DuckDuckGo,
20:11
or we can search for something on Huggingface.
20:13
If you're curious to see how it works, just find inside app.py
20:19
look for the get search topic function.
20:22
This function is listening to instances of search inside your prompt,
20:27
and it checks if it ends with on hugging face,
20:30
or on the web, or on the internet and so on.
20:33
It will then extract the search topic from the prompt,
20:37
and then it will automatically call the appropriate MCP tool.
20:41
Okay, so how does it work?
20:42
Let's say search Mariya Sha
20:46
on the web and tell me
20:49
who she is.
20:51
Okay. Let's have a look at the results.
20:53
Now to remind you, GEMA is way too small to know who I am,
20:58
so unless it actually got access to web search, it will have no idea.
21:02
Okay, it will start hallucinating or something.
21:05
So let's scroll up and let's see. Mariya.
21:07
She is a software developer and a content creator
21:10
focused on making programing and AI accessible.
21:13
Wow, okay.
21:14
Primarily known for her YouTube channel, Python
21:17
simplified so it even found this channel.
21:20
And it also found my LinkedIn, my Instagram, my GitHub, my website.
21:24
Holy moly.
21:26
Now another cool thing is that in addition to this response from the model,
21:30
we are also displaying the full search results from DuckDuckGo.
21:34
Now, if you're curious about other tools that we haven't tried yet,
21:38
just go back to your Docker desktop and expand any kind of server.
21:41
Let's go for playwright and inside the tools section
21:45
you will find all the tool names as well as their description,
21:49
at least a brief description, but if you're looking
21:51
